### 03/2021 - present

- **Lopa Explorer, 09/2021 - 05/2023**: Develop for *Airbus* a software solution to generate cabin configurations for different types of aircrafts given the airline requirements. The solution is based on a **constraint programming model** and **multi-objective optimization**. The developped *Lopa Explorer* allows the exploration of all the possible configurations for a specified scenario in less than *2 min*.  <img src="https://hebbalali.github.io/Hebbalali/assets/Airbus-Logo-700x394.png" alt="airbus" style="float:right;width:10;">

### 09/2017 - 01/2021

- **Deep Gaussian processes for the analysis and optimization of complex systems**: Different challenges in the analysis and optimization of complex systems using Gaussian processes have been addressed, mainly: 
    - optimization of black-box computationally expensive function with non-stationary behavior,
    - multi-objective optimization taking into account the correlation between objectives,
    - multi-fidelity analysis in the case of fidelities with different input spaces.


The approaches developped to deal with these challenges are based on deep Gaussian processes:
    - a Bayesian optimization with deep Gaussian processes to deal with non-stationary functions,
    - a multi-objective deep Gaussian process model that takes into account the correlation between objectives,
    - a multi-fidelity model deep Gaussian process model that maps between the input spaces of the fidelities.
