Hi dear visitor,

I'am Ali, a Ph.D in computer science and an industrial engineer interested in the application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods in real-world industrial problems. My domains of expertise are Bayesian deep learning and optimization. 

My journey reflects a profound commitment to data science, Bayesian modeling, and optimization. With an academic background steeped in mathematical rigor, I bring a robust analytical framework to address complex challenges. This, coupled with my hands-on experience in Bayesian optimization, operational research, and data science, positions me at the intersection of mathematical rigor and the world of data.


In this website I will share my different open source contributions. This concerns python codes on Gaussian processes, Deep Gaussian processes and optimization as well as my talks and papers.
