## The journey

Hello, I am Ali, a Ph.D. in Computer Science and an industrial engineer with a passion for applying state-of-the-art machine learning methods and optimization algorithms to solve real-world industrial problems. My area of expertise is in Bayesian deep learning and optimization.

My journey into the world of machine learning and optimization began during my engineering studies in industrial engineering at Ecole Mohammadia d'Ing√©nieurs. It was during my final year thesis when I had the opportunity to apply these concepts in the context of supply chain management. This experience ignited my interest in research, and I subsequently pursued a Master of Research in Computer Science at Paris Dauphine with a focus on optimization. This led me to a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Onera-The French Aerospace Lab, where I focused on using machine learning models, particularly Deep Gaussian Processes, to solve optimization problems in aerospace vehicle design.

After completing my thesis, I joined Hybrid Intelligence, a division of Capgemini Engineering, as an optimization and machine learning consultant. One of my significant projects was the development of a mathematical optimization model to explore the cabin configuration design of aircrafts for Airbus. The model was developed using ORtools and CPSolver, along with multi-objective optimization.

Overall, my passion lies in the application of cutting-edge machine learning methods to solve complex industrial problems, and I look forward to exploring new challenges in this exciting field.
