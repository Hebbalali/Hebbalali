# [Deep Gaussain processes toolbox](https://github.com/Hebbalali/dgp-toolbox)

This repository contains the codes for my different contributions in deep Gaussian processes for the analysis and optimization of complex systems.

It contains the code for:
- Bayesian optimization for deep Gaussian processes,
- the improved multi-fidelity deep Gaussian process model,
- the multi-fidelity deep Gaussian process embedded model (MF-DGP-EM) for varying input spaces fidelities,
- the multi-objective deep Gaussian process model (MO-DGP)
